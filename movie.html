    <!-- idea: when movie is clicked on, save a json object in local storage and use it 
    after navigating to the display movie html page to fill in the contents (so we don't
    need a new html for each movie entry - have review feature on that page) -->

        <h3>Genres:</h3>
        // add genre buttons here and put them on the same line with flexbox

      // put movies here
      <br>
        <a href="review.html"><button><h3>Example movie button</h3></button></a>
        <br> 
        - maybe use carousel motion here with the movie pics
        <br>
        - each movie button is the movie cover

    </div>
    - sign in stores user stuff into the user table (add a password attribute to check for login)
    <br>
    - login will lead to a login page which checks with the user table to see if the user exits
    and if the password matches with the user - give corresponding error messages
    <br>
    - after logging in, store the userID in local storage so the user is allowed to make reviews 
    under their corresponding name
    <br>
    - block review making if the user is not logged in (userID in local storage is empty or NULL)
    <br>
    - maybe when logged in, add a recommended movies carousel at top with movies of similar genres
    to what the user had recently reviewed (user review table to check this)
    <br>
    - when logged in, an already reviewed movies carousel
    <br>
    - when logged in, an not-yet reviewed movies carousel
    <br> 
    - Possibly change all the ID's to auto increment whenever we add it
    (especially for userID - whenever a user account is created)
    <br>
    - do we need to use locking for this project?
      - lock when user account is being added to user
